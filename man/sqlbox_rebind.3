.Dt SQLBOX_REBIND 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sqlbox_rebind
.Nd rebind parameters to a statement
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb sqlbox
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stddef.h
.In sqlbox.h
.Ft size_t
.Fo sqlbox_rebind
.Fa "struct sqlbox *box"
.Fa "size_t id"
.Fa "size_t psz"
.Fa "const struct sqlbox_parm *ps"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Rebinds parameters to a statement
.Fa id
as returned by
.Xr sqlbox_prepare_bind 3 .
If
.Fa id
is zero, the last prepared statement is used.
This resets the statement and removes any previously-bound parameters.
The number of parameters
.Fa psz
must match the prepared statement parameters given in the SQL or be
zero.
.Pp
The
.Fa ps
array, if
.Fa psz
is non-zero, consists of typed values bound to those parameters.
Types must correspond to typed values, for example, floats of type
.Dv SQLBOX_PARM_FLOAT
must be set in the
.Va fparm
of
.Vt struct sqlbox_parm .
.Pp
The
.Va sz
of
.Vt struct sqlbox_parm
is ignored for floats and integers, but must be provided for blobs and
optionally for strings.
For strings, a zero indicates it should be computed using
.Xr strlen 3 .
Otherwise, it should be the full string length including the NUL
terminator.
If the string is shorter than the given length (i.e., contains an
embedded NUL terminator), the database will still return the full given
length of the original size (terminating NUL inclusive).
.Ss SQLite3 Implementation
The statement is first reset with
.Xr sqlite3_reset 3 ,
its existing bound parameters removed with
.Xr sqlite3_clear_bindings 3 ,
then new parameters bound with
.Xr sqlite3_bind_blob 3
and family.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Returns zero if
.Fa id
is invalid, strings are not NUL-terminated at their size (if non-zero),
memory allocation fails, or communication with
.Fa box
fails.
Otherwise it returns the >0 statement identifier.
.Pp
If rebinding to the statement fails, subsequent
.Fa box
access will fail.
Use
.Xr sqlbox_ping 3
to check explicitly.
.Pp
If
.Fn sqlbox_rebind
fails,
.Fa box
is no longer accessible beyond
.Xr sqlbox_ping 3
and
.Xr sqlbox_free 3 .

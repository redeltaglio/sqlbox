.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm sqlbox
library is a secure database access library at this time limited to
sqlite3 databases.
Instead of operating databases in-process,
.Nm
uses a multi-process, resource-separated approach to safe-guard the
database from the calling application.
It is most effective on
.Ox
when used with
.Xr pledge 2 .
.Pp
The typical usage scenario is as follows:
.Bl -enum
.It
allocate a context with
.Xr sqlbox_alloc 3 ,
.It
open a database connection in that context with
.Xr sqlbox_open 3 ,
.It
execute statements with
.Xr sqlbox_prepare_bind 3
or
.Xr sqlbox_exec 3 ,
.It
explicitly close databases with
.Xr sqlbox_close 3 ,
.It
free the context with
.Xr sqlbox_free 3 .
.El
.Pp
There's also support for transactions
.Xr sqlbox_trans_immediate 3
and
.Xr sqlbox_trans_commit 3 ,
which should be used instead of manually specifying SQL transactions to
prevent nested requests.
.Pp
The current version of
.Nm
is defined in
.Dv SQLBOX_VERSION
as a string of major number, minor number, and build.
These values are available seperately as
.Dv SQLBOX_VMAJOR ,
.Dv SQLBOX_VMINOR ,
and
.Dv SQLBOX_VBUILD ,
respectively.
A numeric concatenation of the version is defined as
.Dv SQLBOX_VSTAMP ,
which may be used to test for version number applicability.
.Ss Pledge Promises
The
.Nm
library is built to operate with applications that use
.Xr pledge 2
on
.Ox
to limit file-system access.
This protects the database from direct tampering and forces the
application to use the socket channel for communication.
.Ox .
.Pp
Prior to calling
.Xr sqlbox_alloc 3 ,
the application may pledge with
.Va stdio rpath cpath wpath flock proc fattr
and only
.Va stdio
afterward.

.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Fa "struct sqlbox *box"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sqlbox_trans_commit
and
.Fn sqlbox_trans_rollback
functions close a transaction identified as non-zero
.Fa id
previously opened with the
.Xr sqlbox_trans_immediate 3
family on source
.Fa srcid
as returned by
.Xr sqlbox_open 3 .
If
.Fa srcid
is zero, the last-opened database is used.
.Pp
These functions differ in that
.Fn sqlbox_trans_commit
will commit all statements subsequent to beginning the transaction and
.Fn sqlbox_trans_rollback
will discard them.
.Pp
It is an error to
.Xr sqlbox_close 3
a database without first rolling back or committing open transactions.
.Ss SQLite3 Implementation
Runs
.Xr sqlite3_exec
using the
.Cm COMMIT
or
.Cm ROLLBACK
statements with the type depending on the invocation.
Randomly backs off on return of
.Dv SQLITE_BUSY ,
.Dv SQLITE_LOCKED ,
or
.Dv SQLITE_PROTOCOL ,
and returns failure on anything else other than
.Dv SQLITE_OK .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Returns zero if communication with
.Fa box
fails.
Otherwise, returns non-zero.
.Pp
If ending the transaction fails (not open, different transaction already
open, source not found, database errors,
.Fa id
or
.Fa srcid
are zero), subsequent
.Fa box
access will fail.
Use
.Xr sqlbox_ping 3
to check explicitly.
.Pp
If these functions fail,
.Fa box
is no longer accessible beyond
.Xr sqlbox_ping 3
and
.Xr sqlbox_free 3 .

.Dt SQLBOX_CLOSE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sqlbox_close
.Nd close a database
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb sqlbox
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stddef.h
.In sqlbox.h
.Ft int
.Fo sqlbox_open
.Fa "struct sqlbox *box"
.Fa "size_t id"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Close the database previously opened with
.Xr sqlbox_open 3 .
The caller must have a role capable of opening and closing the given
database source.
.Pp
If
.Fn sqlbox_close
is not called, the database will automatically be closed with
.Xr sqlbox_free 3 .
This is not considered an error, as a common usage pattern is a role
with permission opening the database, shedding its role, then the close
being relegated to the full destruction of the box.
.Pp
Once a source identifier has been closed, subsequent calls to
.Fn sqlbox_close
with the same identifier will fail.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Returns non-zero if communication with the box works, zero otherwise.
If closing the source fails (database not open or does not exist,
statements not finalised), subsequent access will fail.
Use
.Xr sqlbox_ping 3
to check synchronously.
